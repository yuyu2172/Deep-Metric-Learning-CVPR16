# Deep Metric Learning via Lifted Structured Feature Embedding
This repository has the source code and the Stanford Online Products dataset for the paper "Deep Metric Learning via Lifted Structured Feature Embedding" (CVPR16). The paper preprint is available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06452). If you just need the Caffe code, check out the [Submodule](https://github.com/rksltnl/Caffe-Deep-Metric-Learning-CVPR16). For the loss layer implementation, look at [here](https://github.com/rksltnl/Caffe-Deep-Metric-Learning-CVPR16/blob/0efd7544a9846f58df923c8b992198ba5c355454/src/caffe/layers/lifted_struct_similarity_softmax_layer.cpp).

## Installation
1. Install prerequsites for `Caffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))
2. Compile the `Caffe-Deep-Metric-Learning-CVPR16` Github submodule.

## Prerequisites 
1. Download pretrained GoogLeNet model from [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_googlenet)
2. Download the ILSVRC12 ImageNet mean file for mean subtraction. Refer to Caffe the ImageNet examples  [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/examples/imagenet).
3. Modify and run `code/gen_splits.m` to create train/test split.
4. Modify and run `code/gen_images.m` to prepare the preprocessed images.

## Training Procedure
1. Generate the LMDB file to convert the training set of images to the DB format. Example scripts are in `code/` directory.
 * Modify and run `code/compile.m` to mex compile the cpp files used for LMDB generation.
 * Modify `code/config.m` to set save paths.
 * Run `code/gen_caffe_dataset_multilabel_m128.m` to start the LMDB generation process.
2. Create the `model/train*.prototxt` and `model/solver*.prototxt` files. Please refer to the included `*.prototxt` files in `model/` directory for examples. You also need to provide the path to the ImageNet mean file (usually called `imagenet_mean.binaryproto`) you downloaded in step 2.
3. Inside the caffe submodule, launch the Caffe training procedure.
`caffe/build/tools/caffe train -solver [path-to-training-prototxt-file] -weights [path-to-pretrained-googlenet] -gpu [gpuid]`

## Feature extraction after training
1. Modify and run `code/gen_caffe_validation_imageset.m` to convert the test images to LMDB format.
1. Modify the test set path in `model/extract_googlenet*.prototxt`.
2. Modify the model and test set path and run `code/compute_googlenet_distance_matrix_cuda_embeddings_liftedstructsim_softmax_pair_m128.py`.

## Clustering and Retrieval evaluation code
1. Use `code/evaluation/evaluate_clustering.m` to evaluate the clustering performance.
2. Use `code/evaluation/evaluate_recall.m` to evaluate recall@K for image retrieval.

## Stanford Online Products dataset
You can download the Stanford Online Products dataset (2.9G) from ftp://cs.stanford.edu/cs/cvgl/Stanford_Online_Products.zip
* We also have the text meta data for each product images. Please let us know if you're interested in using them.

## Our Pre-trained Models
